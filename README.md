# Professional-R

##Description:
Creating an open source project on GitHub is important, so it is even more important to have a professional README.md file as it will ensure; clients, colleagues and employers understand the fundamental use and purpose of your application.

Thus, allowing users among the GitHub community to save valuable time among their projects. Thereby, allowing them to optimize focus and efficency onto other priorities in order to achieve their goals.
